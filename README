Getting rails working (in theory)

Commands that worked for Diane:
sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems                          # Get ruby and the gems package manager
sudo gem install rails --version 3.0.9                      # Install version 3.0.9 of rails
sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev # Get essential dev packages for rails
bundle install # Does this need sudo? Where does the bundle binary come from?
